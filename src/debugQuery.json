                    "About the Company\n\nMost companies hire based on gut feel and credentials, not evidence of a candidate’s ability to excel at the job. Today's most forward-thinking Engineering leaders know that talent is everywhere and comes from a variety of backgrounds. They know that great senior engineers are great at debugging, technical communication, and architecture beyond writing great code. Woven scenarios allow hiring teams to predict how well candidates will perform on the job, not how well they will perform in an interview.\n\nAbout You\n\nOver your career, you’ve built production level systems (preferably with Ruby on Rails, but that’s not a hard requirement). You’ve participated in technical interviews - both as an interviewer and interviewee. You’ve developed opinions about what works and what doesn’t work and how to make these interviews more engaging and unbiased.\n\nThe Problem You’ll Own\n\nWe’ve built a system that helps companies find highly qualified engineers by using a series of real world scenarios during their interview process. No trick questions, no puzzles, no FizzBuzz. Think debugging live systems, designing new ones, and collaborating on technical topics. These help the candidate show what they are truly capable of doing and allow our customers to find amazing engineers for their team.\n\nYou’ll be building new features to help improve the hiring manager experience - be it selecting appropriate challenges for their roles or evaluating candidates that have applied to roles. You’ll be working to make our candidate experience even better. To eliminate the gap between talent and opportunity, we must build a platform that supports the same level of quality at scale. That’s where you come in.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing\n\nTaking the platform to the next level by implementing features to support both our customers and their candidates.\nSupporting a team of engineers to ensure our customers are evaluating their candidates for the role they need to fill with scenarios to reflect real world problems - no puzzles, no trick questions, no FizzBuzz.\nWorking on the full stack using Ruby on Rails, React, and modern JavaScript\n\nYou can do most work asynchronously, and we'd like the ability to work together as needed. As a result, we'd ideally like applicants to be within a few hours of US Eastern time, but are open to a wider time range for the right candidate. We’re a fully distributed team and collaborate mostly over Slack and Zoom.\n\nExperience you have\n\nThis role can span a mid-career to senior level engineer. You probably have 3+ years of professional software engineering experience\nYou’ve worked in different areas of the stack (e.g. front end, backend, mobile)\nYou have experience working in a remote environment with teammates in multiple time zones.\n\nNice to haves\n\nThese are not requirements of the role, especially for non-senior candidates, but they will aid in your ability to join and contribute to the team rapidly.\n\nWorking knowledge of automated unit tests in backend and frontend technology stacks\nWorking knowledge of some of the following technologies: Ruby, Rails, Applicant Tracking Systems (Lever, Greenhouse, Workable, etc), Heroku, Sidekiq, Python, React\nWorking knowledge of low/no code systems like Airtable, Trello, Front, Slack\nA polyglot, familiar with both dynamic and statically typed languages\nMost of our current stack is Ruby, JavaScript, Python, and React. Our scenarios are in All The Languages\nExperience performing light user-testing of features or prototypes with customers\nExperience translating high-fidelity design mockups to working code\nInterest in software engineering challenges/scenarios\n\nWhat’s in it for you\n\nRadical transparency: company financials, compensation, strategy, etc\nFully remote work at a remote-first company with flexible hours\nAnnual cash compensation: ~$145k\nSignificant equity (and the info to fairly value that equity) in a high-growth startup\nUnlimited PTO with 38 days off minimum\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance\n401(k) plan w/ match\n8 weeks 100% paid parental leave at 1 year\nA tech stipend for great gear, home office improvements, and extracurricular learning\nA passionate team of co-conspirators\n\nWe encourage you to apply even if you don't have this exact experience!

        "description": "About the Company\n\nMost companies hire based on gut feel and credentials, not evidence of a candidate’s ability to excel at the job. Today's most forward-thinking Engineering leaders know that talent is everywhere and comes from a variety of backgrounds. They know that great senior engineers are great at debugging, technical communication, and architecture beyond writing great code. Woven scenarios allow hiring teams to predict how well candidates will perform on the job, not how well they will perform in an interview.\n\nAbout You\n\nOver your career, you’ve built production level systems (preferably with Ruby on Rails, but that’s not a hard requirement). You’ve participated in technical interviews - both as an interviewer and interviewee. You’ve developed opinions about what works and what doesn’t work and how to make these interviews more engaging and unbiased.\n\nThe Problem You’ll Own\n\nWe’ve built a system that helps companies find highly qualified engineers by using a series of real world scenarios during their interview process. No trick questions, no puzzles, no FizzBuzz. Think debugging live systems, designing new ones, and collaborating on technical topics. These help the candidate show what they are truly capable of doing and allow our customers to find amazing engineers for their team.\n\nYou’ll be building new features to help improve the hiring manager experience - be it selecting appropriate challenges for their roles or evaluating candidates that have applied to roles. You’ll be working to make our candidate experience even better. To eliminate the gap between talent and opportunity, we must build a platform that supports the same level of quality at scale. That’s where you come in.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing\n\nTaking the platform to the next level by implementing features to support both our customers and their candidates.\nSupporting a team of engineers to ensure our customers are evaluating their candidates for the role they need to fill with scenarios to reflect real world problems - no puzzles, no trick questions, no FizzBuzz.\nWorking on the full stack using Ruby on Rails, React, and modern JavaScript\n\nYou can do most work asynchronously, and we'd like the ability to work together as needed. As a result, we'd ideally like applicants to be within a few hours of US Eastern time, but are open to a wider time range for the right candidate. We’re a fully distributed team and collaborate mostly over Slack and Zoom.\n\nExperience you have\n\nThis role can span a mid-career to senior level engineer. You probably have 3+ years of professional software engineering (not including internships) experience\nYou’ve worked in different areas of the stack (e.g. front end, backend, mobile)\nYou have experience working in a remote environment with teammates in multiple time zones.\n\nNice to haves\n\nThese are not requirements of the role, especially for non-senior candidates, but they will aid in your ability to join and contribute to the team rapidly.\n\nWorking knowledge of automated unit tests in backend and frontend technology stacks\nWorking knowledge of some of the following technologies: Ruby, Rails, Applicant Tracking Systems (Lever, Greenhouse, Workable, etc), Heroku, Sidekiq, Python, React\nWorking knowledge of low/no code systems like Airtable, Trello, Front, Slack\nA polyglot, familiar with both dynamic and statically typed languages\nMost of our current stack is Ruby, JavaScript, Python, and React. Our scenarios are in All The Languages\nExperience performing light user-testing of features or prototypes with customers\nExperience translating high-fidelity design mockups to working code\nInterest in software engineering challenges/scenarios\n\nWhat’s in it for you\n\nRadical transparency: company financials, compensation, strategy, etc\nFully remote work at a remote-first company with flexible hours\nAnnual cash compensation: ~$145k\nSignificant equity (and the info to fairly value that equity) in a high-growth startup\nUnlimited PTO with 38 days off minimum\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance\n401(k) plan w/ match\n8 weeks 100% paid parental leave at 1 year\nA tech stipend for great gear, home office improvements, and extracurricular learning\nA passionate team of co-conspirators\n\nWe encourage you to apply even if you don't have this exact experience! In the worst case, you’ll waste a bit of time on your application. In the best case, you land your dream job. It's worth a shot, right?\n\nWe recently raised our series A totaling $10MM in funding from High Alpha and Allos Ventures - investors in incredible companies like Lessonly, Salesloft and G2.\n\nWe believe that diversity is integral to our success, and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, age, or any other basis protected by law.\n\nJob Type: Full-time\n\nPay: $125,000.00 - $145,000.00 per year\n\nBenefits:\n\n401(k)\nFlexible schedule\nHealth insurance\nPaid time off\nParental leave\n\nSchedule:\n\n8 hour shift\n\nWork Location: Remote",

We believe all candidates, regardless of who they are, should have a fair chance to work. Established in 2014 and valued at $5B, Checkr is using technology to bring hiring to the next level. Our People Trust Platform uses machine learning to help thousands of companies modernize their background check process and make hiring safer, more efficient, and more inclusive. Some of our customers include Uber, Instacart, Doordash, Netflix, Compass Group, and Adecco.\n\nA career with Checkr is an opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest minds, disrupt an industry for a better future, and give otherwise overlooked candidates access to employment. Checkr has been recognized in Forbes Best Startup Employers and is a top Y Combinator company by valuation.\n\nWe are looking for a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer to join the Background Check Program! The background check program is composed of the Criminal, Motor Vehicle, and Verifications teams. Our work involves orchestrating the flow of information from when a customer first places an order for a background check to interacting with data from thousands of sources to delivering the final report to customers and candidates. This is the core product and beating heart of Checkr.\n\nAs a member of the Verifications team, your focus will be on a wide product portfolio that includes Drug and Health Screenings, Employment and Education Verifications, and Professional License Verifications to name several in the product space, but also collaborating with the Criminal and Motor Vehicle team on cross-functional initiatives.\n\nBecause we process millions of records each year, every engineering challenge our group faces – compliance, data quality, speed, and reliability – is a challenge we face at scale. We also face deep product challenges from a highly fragmented and decentralized data ecosystem, which means every engineering choice we make is also an opportunity to reduce bias in the hiring process.\n\nYou will work in a collection of small services built on Ruby and Javascript, with both SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as message queues for asynchronous tasks. Checkr was founded by engineers for engineers; we want to create the best environment for developers to build, learn and love their work.\n\nWe are looking for teammates that are highly collaborative, enjoy pairing to solve problems, care deeply about the mission of our company (improving fairness in the criminal justice system), and are eager to work with a diverse team (42% of engineers across the background check program identify as women).\n\nWhat you bring:\n\n5+ years of software development experience\nA preference towards collaboration, TDD, and pair programming\nExperience writing performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code\nExperience with microservices, queueing architectures, and APIs\nExperience spearheading adoption of best practices for the entire team to improve code quality and velocity\nExperience providing mentorship to junior engineers\nRuby experience or a desire to learn Ruby\n\nWhat you get\n\nA fast-paced and collaborative environment\nLearning and development allowance\nCompetitive compensation and opportunity for advancement\n100% medical, dental, and vision coverage\nUp to 25K reimbursement for fertility, adoption, and parental planning services\nFlexible PTO policy\nMonthly wellness stipend, home office stipend\n\nThe base salary for this position will vary based on geography and other factors. In accordance with Colorado law, the base salary for this role if filled within Colorado is $129,200-$152,000.\n\nEqual Employment Opportunities at Checkr\nCheckr is committed to hiring talented and qualified individuals with diverse backgrounds for all of its tech, non-tech, and leadership roles. Checkr believes that the gathering and celebration of unique backgrounds, qualities, and cultures enriches the workplace.\nCheckr also welcomes the opportunity to consider qualified applicants with prior arrest or conviction records. Checkr's commitment to diversity extends to hiring talented individuals in spite of a prior criminal history in accordance with local, state, and/or federal laws, including the San Francisco's Fair Chance Ordinance.\n\n#LI-Remote"

You will provide technical expertise across design, implementation and support of the customer-facing components of our enterprise SaaS solution.\n\nWe’re looking for a strong product engineer who works well on a small team and is excited about the opportunity to have a direct impact on improving customer experience. As a principal engineer, you are someone who can rapidly assess requirements and design solutions, plan development beginning to end, coach others, and self-manage, requiring good organizational skills and attention to detail.

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can just click a button and set up a new employees' payroll, health insurance, work computer, and third-party apps—like Slack, Zoom, and Office 365—all within 90 seconds.\n\nBased in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $700M from the world's top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes (#12 out of 500).\nAbout The Role\n\nRippling is looking for someone to lead architecture initiatives that will support Rippling's continued scalability and performance through a period of hypergrowth. As one of the most senior technical roles in the company, they will work with teams across the organization to explore the company's most challenging technical problems, and develop solutions for them. A successful leader in this role will have exceptional insight on scaling distributed systems, and ability to project influence across the organization, coupled with a hands-on attitude and willingness to drive projects to completion.\n\nWhat You'll Do:\nLead the design and implementation of the next generation of Rippling's frameworks, including a service oriented architecture, a platform for ingesting and processing employee data at scale, and a domain specific language.\nEnsure Rippling's continued scalability and performance through a period of hypergrowth\nAnticipate technical challenges facing Rippling before they arise, and design and implement solutions to solve them.\nWork with teams facing complex technical challenges of their own. Be a catalyst for developing high quality software and architecture across the company.\nRepresent Rippling technology externally, through conferences, papers, and blog posts.\nQualifications:\n10+ years of software engineering experience, with 5+ years in technical lead or architect roles\nExperience building large-scale distributed systems, such as high-volume SaaS environments, or data processing platforms\nAbility to thrive in an ambiguous environment by identifying areas of impact and independently pursuing them\nA track record of influencing and enabling forward-thinking technology decisions across a wide organization\nExcellent ability to communicate complex technical ideas with clarity and precision in written and verbal modes\n\nIf you don't necessarily meet all of the requirements listed here, we still encourage you to apply because skills can be used in lots of different ways, your life experience is equally important sometimes.\n\n#LI-CB2\n\nIf you don't meet all of the requirements listed here, we still encourage you to apply.

                    "What we're building\n\nAt Tidelift, we are making open source work better for everyone by helping organizations effectively manage the open source behind modern applications while ensuring open source maintainers get paid for the incredible value they create. We are creating a mutually beneficial commercial model for open source where both creators and enterprise users get what they need, and the world gets even more healthy and secure software that improves our lives.\n\nWe're well-funded and growing fast. You will play a large role in tackling challenging problems and helping expand the company, while learning alongside our experienced team.\n\nFind out more about us on tidelift.com, listen to this recent podcast interview with our CEO Donald Fischer, or read about us in Wired or Business Insider.\n\nThe role\n\nWe’re looking for senior engineers to jump in and help us continue to build a product that is used by developers and benefits open source maintainers! Our backend is mostly written in Ruby although we have been starting to build some small components with Go. And of course, there is JavaScript on the frontend. The backend includes APIs consumed by the frontend as well as a backend processing pipeline. As a principal engineer, you will be responsible for the design of large components of our product as well as having a role in mentoring and guiding more junior engineers on the team. At this level, in addition to being a generalist, there is probably an area or two where you consider yourself exceptionally strong which could be frontend development, operations, systems design, managing small numbers of people, or perhaps skills we haven’t considered.\n\nTidelift is working with companies to make it simple to trust, ship, and grow open source. Our customers use our tools and services to centralize and reduce the effort required to take care of the open source they rely on. You can read the docs to learn more, and ask us tough questions.\n\nStarting pay:\n\n$190,000 per year base salary\nGenerous stock option grant\n\nConfidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. Tidelift is a place where everyone can grow. So however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, please apply if this is a role that would make you excited to come into work every day.\n\nThe team\n\nWe want a team where everyone cares about users, design, building a business, and one another. We’re also aiming for work-life harmony: we believe in doing good work, with urgency and pragmatism, but at a sustainable pace. We value big impact as opposed to long hours.\n\nOur values\n\nWe’re trying to build a healthy, values-driven culture. We want to be:\n\nOptimistic: We see an amazing future ahead, and want to inspire others to share in it. This is both internal—building each other up and looking for the best in people—and external—we know open source is awesome, and we want to make it even better.\n\nPractical: We know words and ideas alone won’t change lives. We help people most by creating a pragmatic, viable, and sustainable business that works for everyone. So we care about usability, design, and honest assessment of costs and benefits.\n\nAdditive: We want an environment that encourages and inspires growth, both for individuals and for the open source community as a whole. That means embracing a growth mindset, and valuing culture-add over culture-fit.\n\nInclusive: We believe technology will be stronger when it better reflects the voices and ideas of society as a whole. So we want people from different backgrounds and experiences to not just be represented, but to be heard, valued, and flourish. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment.\n\nTo find out more about how we live these in practice, we’ve written more about living our values “inside and out”.\n\nWorking at Tidelift\n\nWe are (and have been) remote-first from day 1.

We’ve written more about how we do remote work here, here, and here.\n\nWe believe in the urgency of our mission and the importance of doing good work, but also know this is a marathon and not a sprint. Hours are flexible when necessary to meet personal needs (like child, medical, or elder care).\n\nTidelift is committed to the safety of its employees, and so requires that all employees be vaccinated for COVID before participating in any in-person company activities.\n\nCompensation, benefits and career\n\nTidelift’s approach to compensation is designed to ensure that we are staying true to our core values of being optimistic, additive, inclusive, and practical. We do this by:\n\n\n\n\nRewarding tenure: We are optimists, believing that each of us is bringing our best to work each day. In this spirit, we provide predetermined raises of at least 3% each year based on the belief that you are working hard and learning more about Tidelift and your role, making yourself more valuable to the company every day. Each year we will refresh our model for rewarding tenure with new market data, and share an updated compensation trajectory with you.\n\nHolding firmly to a no-negotiation policy: In the spirit of our values to be inclusive and additive, we believe employees hired to perform the same role should receive the same compensation, regardless of location, negotiation prowess, prior salary, or years of experience prior to joining Tidelift. All Tidelift offers have compensation packages that are determined prior to the start of recruitment. This, along with a structured interview process, is intended to mitigate the effects of both shifting criteria bias and the ask gap on wages within Tidelift, and is an essential element of our equity, diversity, and inclusion strategy.\n\nSharing our process transparently. You and your colleagues are doing important work, and we want to compensate you fairly in return. We transparently document how we approach compensation at Tidelift, including our methodology for calculating initial offers, raises, and promotions, so that you know exactly what you can expect from us over your career here.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, Tidelift offers medical, dental, vision, disability, and life insurance as well as the ability to contribute pre-tax dollars to flexible spending and retirement (401k) accounts. As a remote-first company, we offer a variety of remote work stipends to cover expenses such as co-working spaces, internet, and phone connections. Finally, all employees have access to generous vacation and gender-neutral parental leave policies as well as the ability to reimburse up to $5k annually for their own professional development.\n\nHow to apply\n\nWe'd love it if you add a thoughtful note about your goals and your background. We’ll get back to you promptly!"

        "description": "What we're building\n\nAt Tidelift, we are making open source work better for everyone by helping organizations effectively manage the open source behind modern applications while ensuring open source maintainers get paid for the incredible value they create. We are creating a mutually beneficial commercial model for open source where both creators and enterprise users get what they need, and the world gets even more healthy and secure software that improves our lives.\n\nWe're well-funded and growing fast. You will play a large role in tackling challenging problems and helping expand the company, while learning alongside our experienced team.\n\nFind out more about us on tidelift.com, listen to this recent podcast interview with our CEO Donald Fischer, or read about us in Wired or Business Insider.\n\nThe role\n\nWe’re looking for senior engineers to jump in and help us continue to build a product that is used by developers and benefits open source maintainers! Our backend is mostly written in Ruby although we have been starting to build some small components with Go. And of course, there is JavaScript on the frontend. The backend includes APIs consumed by the frontend as well as a backend processing pipeline. As a principal engineer, you will be responsible for the design of large components of our product as well as having a role in mentoring and guiding more junior engineers on the team. At this level, in addition to being a generalist, there is probably an area or two where you consider yourself exceptionally strong which could be frontend development, operations, systems design, managing small numbers of people, or perhaps skills we haven’t considered.\n\nTidelift is working with companies to make it simple to trust, ship, and grow open source. Our customers use our tools and services to centralize and reduce the effort required to take care of the open source they rely on. You can read the docs to learn more, and ask us tough questions.\n\nStarting pay:\n\n$190,000 per year base salary\nGenerous stock option grant\n\nConfidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. Tidelift is a place where everyone can grow. So however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, please apply if this is a role that would make you excited to come into work every day.\n\nThe team\n\nWe want a team where everyone cares about users, design, building a business, and one another. We’re also aiming for work-life harmony: we believe in doing good work, with urgency and pragmatism, but at a sustainable pace. We value big impact as opposed to long hours.\n\nOur values\n\nWe’re trying to build a healthy, values-driven culture. We want to be:\n\nOptimistic: We see an amazing future ahead, and want to inspire others to share in it. This is both internal—building each other up and looking for the best in people—and external—we know open source is awesome, and we want to make it even better.\n\nPractical: We know words and ideas alone won’t change lives. We help people most by creating a pragmatic, viable, and sustainable business that works for everyone. So we care about usability, design, and honest assessment of costs and benefits.\n\nAdditive: We want an environment that encourages and inspires growth, both for individuals and for the open source community as a whole. That means embracing a growth mindset, and valuing culture-add over culture-fit.\n\nInclusive: We believe technology will be stronger when it better reflects the voices and ideas of society as a whole.
