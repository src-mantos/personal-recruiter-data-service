# Personal Recruiter Data Service

this project will be the primary interface to extract and transform job post data.



## Maintenance Notes

the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/cli#generate-code) library was chosen for this project primarily due to the robust interface for quickly being able to generate code.

`npx playwright codegen`

this will open a chromium browser and playwright script generator.
